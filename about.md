# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research.

Throughout 2021, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe. The aim of these events is to equip researchers from all career stages with the digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster and smarter. A unique blend of academic and social life, ResBaz is an event unlike any academic conference you have ever been to.
