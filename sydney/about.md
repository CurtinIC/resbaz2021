# About

Sydney's Research Bazaar is a low-cost, 4-day intensive festival and conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

You can get a sense of what ResBaz was like [in 2019](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/sydney/) by looking over the [full program](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/sydney/Resbaz2019_Program.pdf) and you can even see some [photos and video recordings](https://research.unsw.edu.au/resbaz-sydney) of some of the presentations.
