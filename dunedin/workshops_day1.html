            <expandable-heading title="Introduction to the Unix shell">
                The power of the unix shell comes from it's reproduciblity and ability to automate and scale tasks. This is an introductory session to the unix commandline. By the end of this session participants can expect to:
                <ul>
                    <li>open the commandline</li>
                    <li>understand how to navigate and create files and directories</li>
                    <li>run commandline programs</li>
                </ul>

                Useful for:
                <ul>
                    <li>task automation</li>
                    <li>day 2 lessons for Make and Docker</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Targeted skill level: beginner</p>

            <expandable-heading title="Introduction to pattern matching for text searching">
                Have you found yourself repeating the same search but only making small changes each time? Maybe you want to know where all the occurances of a list of words are in a document. Instead of having to perform each search individually there are more efficient
                ways, such as creating code that embodies the commonalities in your search terms.<br> This session will cover the syntax for creating patterns (regular expressions) for use in searching text.
                <ul>
                    <li>match text using simple patterns</li>
                    <li>understand basic regular expression syntax</li>
                </ul>

                Useful for:
                <ul>
                    <li>People who want to improve their understanding of how search works</li>
                    <li>People who use find/replace</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Targeted skill level: beginner</p>

            <expandable-heading title="Using patterns to find and edit files: grep/sed/awk">
                <p>Finding and replacing is a common task for text editing. This session will cover using regular expressions for the purposes of manipulating text by creating patterns. By attending this session you can expect to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>extract text from files that match patterns</li>
                    <li>find and replace text using patterns</li>
                    <li>rearrange columns in files</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>pre-requisites:</b> a working knowledge of navigating the filesystem on the commandline and running commandline programs.</p>
                <p>Targeted skill level: post-beginner</p>
                <p>Software required: MacOS/Linux - Terminal (comes pre-installed). Windows - GitBash</p>
