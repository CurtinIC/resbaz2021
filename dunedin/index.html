                    <h2>Timetable</h2>
                    <p>A draft timetable is shown below</p>

                    <p>Workshop sessions are designed to be tasters for the topics rather than comprehensive lessons. A laptop will be required to fully participate in most workshop sessions.</p>

                    <p><b>Skill level description:</b><br> In order to convey the skill level of a particular workshop the following terms are used to describe the assumed levels of prior knowledge or experience.<br>
                        <br><b>Beginner</b>: Someone new to the topic with minimal prior knowledge of the workshop topic beyond the stated pre-requisites
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Post-beginner</b>: Greater expectation of prior knowledge or experience beyond the direct topic being covered in the workshop
                    </p>

                    <p>In general, the "Entry" stream is recommended for beginners, and the "Other" stream recommended for previous ResBaz or Carpentries workshop attendees.</p>
