Each day there will be two streams of workshops - one targeted at entry level and the other targeted for people with some background knowledge already (i.e. previous ResBaz/Carpentries attendees)

## Entry level stream Day 1:

            R is a programming language that is useful for data analysis, and by learning R you can improve your efficiency and reproducibility of your analysis.
            This is an introductory session to the R programming language. Participants attending this session can expect by the end of the session to understand:
            <ul>
              <li>basic R syntax</li>
              <li>the components of the RStudio interface</li>
              <li>how to compute basic statistics</li>
              <li>where to find further help for R</li>
            </ul>
            Useful for:
            <ul>
              <li>Data analysis</li>
              <li>Day 2: functions in R and data manipulation in R</li>
              <li>Day 3: data visualisation in R</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Targeted skill level: beginner</p>
            <p>Software required: R and RStudio</p>

### Introduction to R syntax

This workshop will provide an overview of how to get started working with R. This will be done by providing a explaination of the RStudio environment and and introduction to the R programming language syntax.

Lesson materials https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html and https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html 

### Introduction to data analysis in R part 1

Requirement: knowledge of basic R syntax

This workshop will introduce how to get started with data in R using the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages for R which are useful for data manipulation and tidying.

### Introduction to data analysis in R part 2

Requirement: knowledge of basic R syntax

Useful: knowledge of the `dplyr` R package

This workshop will introduce how to make plots using the `ggplot2` package in R for visualising data. 


## Other stream Day 1

### Delving deeper into R

This workshop will extend your understanding of R and cover how to interact with non-data.frame structured data. It will also 

### More Tidyverse

Take the time to explore the lesser known functions and packages of the tidyverse. Learn about how to access googlesheets, use times/dates, manipulate text, use functional programming to replace loops, and more.

### Finding things

This workshop will introduce you to the power of regular expressions - a way of searching using patterns. We'll cover how to use patterns to find files, and things in files.


## Entry level day 2

### Introduction to Data Cleaning

This workshop will introduce you to using OpenRefine for data cleaning in a reproducible friendly manner.

### Tidy Projects

This workshop will provide a 'good-enough' practices overview for how to go about setting up and working on a project using reproducible research principles.

### Debugging and troubleshooting tips and tricks

This session will provide you with advice and skills on how to start tackling error messages and where to look for help.

## Other stream Day 2

### Creating websites with GitHub

This workshop will introduce you to the world of using creating simple websites using the markdown language. A it will involve a pratical application of version control principles which can be applied to other code as well. 

### Introduction to workflow languages

This workshop will introduce you to workflow language systems that are used for creating reproducible research workflows.

### Research data management


## Entry level Day 3

### Navigating th UNIX file system



### Useful code snippets for everyday tasks

This session will cover useful code snippets that are designed to improve your overall experience doing computational research. This will include how to customise your BASH and R environments, useful keyboard short cuts, and short pieces of code to do common tasks e.g. read a directory of files into R.

## Other stream Day 3

### Containers

### Text analysis in R
