# About ResBaz Brisbane 2021

Research Bazaar is a low cost skill- and community-building festival where researchers come together to upskill in digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun.

The 2021 Brisbane Research Bazaar will be held in the Advanced Engineering Building at The University of Queensland from **24 to 26 November, 2021**, as a joint collaboration with Queensland University of Technology, Griffith University, the University of Southern Queensland, and the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF). 

There will be also be a **one-day satellite event on 26 November at Griffith's Gold Coast campus**. This one-day event is being coordinated by staff from Griffith University, Bond University, Southern Cross University and the University of New England.

The aim of ResBaz is to equip researchers from all career stages and disciplines with the digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster, and smarter.

# Who can attend?

The event is aimed at researchers at all levels and from all disciplines. We expect most will be from universities or research institutes based in south east Queensland or northern NSW, but anyone with an interest is welcome to attend. ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools.

**If you are a Master's or PhD student, or an early career researcher, then ResBaz Brisbane is definitely for you**! ResBaz Brisbane will help you find others across a range of universities who are exploring the same research problems or trying to learn the same tools and skills. 

ResBaz Brisbane will definitely be one of the most worthwhile networking and skill-building opportunities you can attend in Brisbane this year - and it's fantastic value.
