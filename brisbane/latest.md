Planning is currently underway for 2021 ResBazQld events face to face in both Brisbane and Gold Coast and streaming statewide. Statewide streaming will allow more remote universities such as JCU and CQUniversity to take part via live streaming of talks and sessions. We are also looking to partner with Sydney ResBaz in sharing live streamed events.
